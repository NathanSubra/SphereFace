\f0\fs24 \cf0 For this assignment, the changes I made to the model included tripling the number of convolutional layers (from 4 to 12), surrounding them with PReLu activation functions, and adding some skip connections to maintain gradients over the deeper network. I messed around with doing some image transformations, but I was unable to increase my accuracy (the Horizontal flip was the only useful one, and it was already given to us). Overall, I am not entirely sure why this model has low accuracy (only slightly better than the original), but no changes I seemed to make to the architecture nor data augmentation seemed to be able to fix it!}
